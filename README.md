# 3D Model Rescaling in Unity 3D

This Unity 3D project demonstrates how to dynamically rescale and reposition 3D models by attaching a custom script. The script will allow users to modify the scale and position of any 3D model in real-time, providing a simple yet effective way to interact with models within a game or simulation.

## Features

- Attach a custom script to any 3D model.
- Dynamically rescale the model.
- Update the position of the model in the scene based on predefined values.
- Real-time manipulation for testing and gameplay.
